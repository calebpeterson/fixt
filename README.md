# Fixt

I'm type-o positive. I often botch CLI commands in predictable ways, and then have to robotically fix the command.

Why can't I remember that it's `--amend`, not `--ammend` (two 'm's, really, what is my brain even doing there?)

_Enter `fixt` - a rule-based tool that'll grab the previous command, fix it, and then re-run it._
